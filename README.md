"How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?"
By creating user stories, I am seeing things directly from the user's perspective and building a framework that caters specifically to their needs.  The end result should bring value to the user.

"How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?"
My approach to developing programs would be based on the needs of each individual program.  Agile may not always be the best solution.  But when it seems fit, I want to take advantage of the flexability and adaptiveness of the approach.  When sudden changes arise, I would like to be able to quickly adapt and move forward without having to scrap everything and start over.

"What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?"
I think communication would be the most important trait that would define what it is to be a good team member.  Daily scrum meetings would play a huge role in this; keeping everyone up-to-date with each other's progress and impediments on a daily basis is the best way to stay ahead on a project.  Openness and honesty, admitting each other's strengths and weaknesses, this is how we develop a true sense of team work.
